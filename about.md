I enjoy playing with technology and it is always fun to learn something new. I'm a builder by nature who enjoys seeing progress and growth. It is always cool to have a product to show for my efforts. I've tried my hand with Android AR app making, RPA, 3D printing, 3D scanning, server configuration etc. This Github page here is just me playing and trying out Git and Github.
